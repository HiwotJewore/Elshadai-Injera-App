## 📖 Inspiration
Injera is a unique, thin Ethiopian leavened bread that is difficult to find and prepare abroad. Many skilled home bakers rely on selling it as income, but online ordering tools are limited.  
This app helps connect those bakers with customers and unlocks cultural recipes for premium users.
